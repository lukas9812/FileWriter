The aim of this project is to develop an application that saves files with a preset size limit, specified in the appsettings.json file. If a file exceeds this size limit (in MB), a new file will be created with an incremented index added to the end of the file name (e.g., Data_26_07_2024_1, Data_26_07_2024_1, etc.).

Additionally, the application offers the option to filter specific properties to prevent the storage of unnecessary data.
